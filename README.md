# MARTA_Accessibility
This is an interactive Python script (the file has been uploaded as  notebook) that allows users to choose their MARTA bus/train route and it would return the accessibility percentage of that route along with markers with stops that represent whether a stop is accessible or not. Additionally, users can input their time of arrival to see whether or not a stop is accessible at that time.

GTFS is the main dataset obtained from https://transitfeeds.com/p/marta/65

However, for this project you just need to upload accessibleRoutesMARTA.csv.zip as it's been processed for you already using postgreSQL!
