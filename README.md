# MARTA_Accessibility
This is an interactive Python script that allows users to choose their MARTA bus/train route and it would return the accessibility percentage of that route along with markers with stops that represent whether a stop is accessible or not. Additionally, users can input their time of arrival to see whether or not a stop is accessible at that time.
